# Disaster Plan Best Practices Analyzer

A web application for uploading local government disaster plans and extracting best practices for different types of disasters (fire, flood, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes).

## Features

- üì§ **Upload Disaster Plans**: Support for PDF, TXT, and DOCX formats
- üîç **Smart Search**: Extract best practices based on disaster type
- üéØ **Keyword Filtering**: Refine results with optional keyword search
- üìö **Plan Management**: View all uploaded plans with metadata
- üåê **Web Interface**: User-friendly interface for easy interaction

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/borisvaliance/vra2.git
cd vra2
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

3. **Upload disaster plans**:
   - Enter the government/organization name
   - Select a PDF, TXT, or DOCX file containing the disaster plan
   - Click "Upload Document"

4. **Search for best practices**:
   - Select a disaster type (Fire, Flood, Hurricane, Earthquake, Tornado)
   - Optionally add a keyword to filter results
   - Click "Search Best Practices"

5. **View uploaded plans**:
   - Scroll down to see all uploaded plans
   - Click "Refresh Plans" to update the list

## How It Works

1. **Document Upload**: The system accepts disaster plan documents in multiple formats
2. **Text Extraction**: Content is extracted from uploaded documents using PyPDF2, python-docx, or plain text readers
3. **Best Practice Identification**: The system analyzes the text using keyword matching to identify relevant best practices for specific disaster types
4. **Results Display**: Matching practices are displayed with their source information

## Disaster Types Supported

- üî• **Fire**: Fire safety, evacuation procedures, fire suppression
- üåä **Flood**: Flood preparedness, drainage, water management
- üåÄ **Hurricane**: Storm preparation, shelter protocols, emergency supplies
- ‚ö° **Earthquake**: Seismic safety, structural integrity, drop-cover-hold
